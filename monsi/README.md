## About

This is the official Wails Svelte template.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## Site for key pair generation

https://8gwifi.org/RSAFunctionality?rsasignverifyfunctions=rsasignverifyfunctions&keysize=2048

## VCs 
the only valid VC is bachelorDegree.json

Currently the VC are signed by the site under "Site for key pair generation". For own key generation to be helpful it would also be necessary to create the signatures with an own script.
